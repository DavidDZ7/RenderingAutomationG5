G5 - The impact of refractive index on image cues to perceived gloss David Norman Diaz Estrada davidnd@stud.ntnu.no  Repo for rendering automation in Mitsuba. The python script automates the creation of rendering files (.xmls) for Mitsuba, by reading an .xml template and changing the material parameters such as refractive index, alpha, albedo, sigmaT, as well as the image size and samples per pixel. An .xml file is generated for each rendering configuration. The generated batch file can be used to automate the rendering of the generated .xml files.
